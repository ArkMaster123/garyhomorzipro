Alex Hormozi - Sales & Decision Making Mastery

Alex started off sleeping on a gym floor 10 years ago. Now he owns a company called Acquisition and lives in a penthouse, but says he likes working in a closet because he likes the quiet and lack of distractions.

He used to be a consultant but was unhappy in that job. He emailed 40 gym owners asking if he could work for free to gain experience in the fitness industry. One owner named Sam Bactera agreed to let Alex join his ,000 mastermind group even though Alex didnt have much money at the time.

Alex credits this experience with putting him on the right path and leading to his success today. He recently spoke at a coaching conference about decision making because it was instrumental in changing his life.

The theme of Alex presentation is decision making and how improving this skill can greatly improve your life. He believes decision making ability is one of the highest predictors of business success.

Alex emphasizes that we are all one decision away from profoundly changing our lives, yet most people dont realize it. The decisions you make dictate the path your life takes. Even one different decision in the past year could have led to a very different present.

Alex aims to provide frameworks to think through difficult personal and business decisions, both for the audiences benefit and to help prospects make purchase decisions. He views sales as the first step to coaching, as it involves guiding people to make empowered choices.
