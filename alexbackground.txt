**Topic: Alex's Background**

Alex started off sleeping on a gym floor 10 years ago. Now he owns a company called Acquisition and lives in a penthouse, but says he likes working in a closet because he likes the quiet and lack of distractions.

He used to be a consultant but was unhappy in that job. He emailed 40 gym owners asking if he could work for free to gain experience in the fitness industry. One owner named Sam Bactera agreed to let Alex join his $10,000 mastermind group even though Alex didn't have much money at the time.

Alex credits this experience with putting him on the right path and leading to his success today. He recently spoke at a coaching conference about decision making because it was instrumental in changing his life.

**Topic: The Importance of Decision Making**

The theme of Alex's presentation is decision making and how improving this skill can greatly improve your life. He believes decision making ability is one of the highest predictors of business success.

Alex emphasizes that we are all one decision away from profoundly changing our lives, yet most people don't realize it. The decisions you make dictate the path your life takes. Even one different decision in the past year could have led to a very different present.

Alex aims to provide frameworks to think through difficult personal and business decisions, both for the audience's benefit and to help prospects make purchase decisions. He views sales as the first step to coaching, as it involves guiding people to make empowered choices.

**Topic: What is Power?**

Alex defines power as the ability to influence or direct events or people. If harnessed positively, power amplifies our best traits. We should all aim to gain more power over our lives.

Some view power negatively, associating it with force. But power is neutral - it depends how you apply it. If you're unethical, power amplifies harm. If you're good, power enables tremendous positive impact.

**Topic: Selling with Logic**

Alex considers himself a logical, rational seller. He uses reason over emotion to make sales. In this presentation, he focuses specifically on techniques to close sales using logic and rational arguments.

There are different selling styles - some emotional, some aggressive and pushy. As a logical seller, Alex aims to help prospects' logical brains justify purchasing decisions they already want to make emotionally.

Emotion gets prospects to lower their action threshold and consider buying, but logic makes it stick by providing a solid rationale after the excitement fades. Alex believes business leaders make more logical, less emotional decisions.

**Topic: Overcoming Objections**

Alex outlines common excuses or "objections" prospects give for not buying, like lacking time or money. For each, he provides logical rebuttals to overcome these sales obstacles.

Some key principles:

- Don't directly disagree. Empathize first.
- Peel back objection layers to reach the core real issue.
- Use hypotheticals to reveal flaws in prospects' logic.
- Align with the prospect's identity and goals.

Alex categorizes objections into:

**Circumstances**

- Time - "It's not a good time." Rebuttals: You'll always be busy; best to start now. Your problem isn't lack of time, but how you spend time.
- Money - "I can't afford it." Rebuttals: The high price means you'll try hard. Compare cost to value gained. You'll buy the program somehow - with money or time.

**Others**

- Authority - "I need approval." Rebuttal: Isolate objection and get them to voice specific concerns. Address those. Don't cede power.

**Self**

- Avoidance - "I need to think about it." Rebuttals: Make them explain what thinking achieves. Confront decision now. Make them explain exactly what information they need to decide.

The deepest objections relate to avoiding decisions and personal responsibility. So Alex pushes people to confront reality and take ownership.

**Topic: Investing in Yourself**

Alex strongly advocates investing in educating yourself and developing skills. He believes this provides the highest life returns since knowledge can't be taken away and compounds over time. Paying to learn from others' mistakes allows you to buy time.

Alex views his self-education expenditures as the best investments he's made - far outpacing stocks or real estate. He comes from a family where all assets were seized, underscoring that only skills can't be taken away.

**Topic: Taking Decisive Action**

Alex emphasizes taking decisive action instead of avoiding decisions or waiting for perfect circumstances. He encourages making choices that steer us toward becoming the person we want to be, since one pivotal decision can forever alter life's trajectory.

The reasons we tell ourselves we can't do something are often exactly why we need to, Alex says. Progress requires change, which brings growing pains. But we must compare the pain of change to the pain of remaining stagnant.

**Topic: Attributes of Powerful Decisions**

Powerful decisions help you take control of your life. They are made for your own sake, not someone else's. They move you towards becoming who you aspire to be.

Powerful decisions require belief in yourself and your vision. You must be willing to feel discomfort and endure criticism.without losing confidence.

Powerful decisions mean taking full responsibility. You can't blame circumstances or other people - the power lies within you. They take courage, but enable you to gain strength.

**Topic: Understanding Prospects' Motivations**

To sell effectively, you must understand prospects' motivations and perspectives:

- People want to believe you and buy from you - enable their logical side to justify doing so.
- Prospects buy emotionally but need logical reassurance afterwards, when excitement fades. Logic provides rationale.
- People focus on themselves - appeal to their identity, interests, fears. Don't make it about you.
- Prospects don't care about your offer. They care about how your offer helps them get what they already want. Frame your pitch around this.

**Topic: Building Trust**

Trust is required to influence prospects. You build trust by:

- Demonstrating genuine care for prospects' well-being, not just making the sale. Be willing to lose the sale to do the right thing.
- Showing deep understanding of the prospect's situation and motivations.
- Admitting weaknesses and limits of your offer demonstrates honesty.
- Appearing confident and committed to your vision. Consistency builds trust.
- Asking hard questions shows care for the prospect. Superficiality destroys trust.

The more you focus on prospects' best interests, the more they will trust you.

**Topic: Beliefs on Selling**

Here are some of Alex's core beliefs on selling:

- Selling happens continuously, not just when asking for the sale.
- Expect frequent rejection. It's normal, not failure. The more exposure, the less stressful.
- If you never get pushback on price, you're not charging enough. Strive for some shock.
- Selling properly positions you for an ongoing coaching relationship with prospects after purchase.
- Keep prospect priorities ahead of making the sale. Their welfare must matter more to you than your commission.

**Topic: Qualities of Effective Salespeople**

Alex shares traits that make salespeople effective:

- Genuine desire to help others. Avoid manipulative or overly self-interested attitudes.
- Willingness to take risks and handle rejection. Resilience and persistence are key.
- Knowledge of human psychology. Understand what motivates people and how to appeal logically and emotionally.
- Strong communication skills. Master influencing and persuading others through words, body language, vocal tones.
- High emotional intelligence. Build rapport quickly. Sense others' unspoken needs and concerns.
- Competitiveness and ambition. Tenacity to meet sales goals through sheer willpower.
- Creativity. Generate new angles, objections rebuttals, incentives. Bring imagination to hook prospects.

**Topic: Handling Rejection**

Alex offers tips for handling rejection:

- View "no" as expected, not personal failure. Detach ego.
- The more "nos," the closer you are to the next "yes." Statistics always bear out.
- Study lost sales to improve. Don't blame the prospect - reflect on what you could refine.
- Remember prospects say "no" because they are not yet sold. Your job is to persistently sway them.
- After a "no," ask what would have convinced them. Adjust approach for future.
- Some prospects just won't buy from you. Move on quickly rather than dwelling on what you could have done differently.

**Topic: Mastering Mindsets**

Alex emphasizes cultivating strong mental mindsets:

- Own your power. Don't fall into victimhood or blame external forces. Take full responsibility.
- Be relentlessly resourceful. Stay creative and persistent, no matter the obstacles in your way.
- Embrace positive risk-taking. Take bold chances on yourself. The greatest successes come by putting yourself on the line.
- Reject perfectionism paralysis. Take imperfect action, then refine. Forward motion creates momentum.
- Practice emotional discipline. Don't make reactive decisions based on fleeting emotions. Cultivate objectivity.
- Maintain learning mindset. Voraciously gain knowledge on all aspects of sales, persuasion, and influence.
