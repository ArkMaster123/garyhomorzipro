## Implementation Details

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Add to .env
BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_brave_search_api_key_here
```

### Tool Integration Strategy
1. **Primary**: RAG knowledge base for core business wisdom
2. **Secondary**: Brave Search for current data and trends
3. **Hybrid**: Combine both for comprehensive business insights

### Query Classification
- **Knowledge Base**: "business fundamentals", "sales psychology", "scaling strategies"
- **Web Search**: "current market trends", "2024 data", "recent news"
- **Combined**: "how to apply [principle] in [current market]"

### Frontend Source Display
The system now displays web search sources with full transparency:

#### üîç **Search Input Display**
- Shows search query being executed
- Displays search focus area (market-data, business-news, etc.)
- Shows timeframe filter (24h, 7d, 30d, 1y)

#### üìä **Search Results Display**
- **Sources at bottom**: Clean citations appear after Gary's response (not news-style cards)
- **Numbered references**: [1], [2], [3] format for easy reference
- **Clickable source links**: Direct links to original articles
- **Domain identification**: Shows source website (forbes.com, bloomberg.com, etc.)
- **External link icons**: Clear visual indicators for external links
- **Minimal design**: Doesn't interrupt the conversational flow

#### üé® **Visual Design**
- **Color coding**: Green for successful searches, red for errors, blue for in-progress
- **Responsive layout**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Dark mode support**: Consistent with app theme
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Pure Knowledge**: "What are the fundamentals of customer acquisition?"
2. **Pure Web Search**: "What are the current AI market trends in 2024?"
3. **Hybrid**: "How can I apply Gary's sales principles to the current AI boom?"

### Testing via Frontend UI (Recommended)
The system is fully operational in the frontend! To test:

1. **Set Persona**: Select "Gary Hormozi" in the persona selector
2. **Test Queries**:
   - **Knowledge Base**: "What is your advice on decision making?"
   - **Web Search**: "What are the latest AI business trends in 2024?"  
   - **Hybrid**: "How can I apply your sales principles to the current AI market?"

### Expected Behavior
1. **Search Indicator**: Brief "Searching for current information..." message
2. **Gary's Response**: Full Gary Hormozi analysis with energy and insights
3. **Sources at Bottom**: Clean numbered citations [1], [2], [3] with clickable links
4. **Integrated Wisdom**: Gary combines web data with core business principles seamlessly

### Example User Experience
```
User: "What are the latest news on national insurance costs in UK?"

üîç Searching for current information...

Gary's Response:
"Listen, based on the latest data I'm seeing, here's what's happening with UK National Insurance costs right now...

[Gary's full energetic analysis with specific data points and actionable advice]

# Test RAG only
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What is your advice on decision making?"}]}'
